❯ Can you use bash?

● Yes, I can use bash to run shell commands. For example:

● Bash(echo "Hello from bash!")
  ⎿  Hello from bash!

● Yes — I can run shell commands, install packages, run builds, execute scripts,
   interact with git, and more. What do you need?

❯ can you edit files?

● Yes, I can edit files. I have several tools for working with files:

  - Read — read file contents
  - Edit — modify specific parts of existing files
  - Write — create new files or overwrite existing ones
  - Glob — find files by name/pattern
  - Grep — search file contents

  What would you like me to do?

❯ What does the setting says for editing files?

● Let me check the relevant configuration.

● Searched for 2 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

❯ just local settings

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Your local settings have Write and Edit in the deny list. This means I'll be
  prompted for your approval every time I try to write or edit a file — I can't
  do it automatically. You'd need to approve each file change individually.

  If you want to change that, you can modify the permissions section in
  .claude/settings.local.json to allow or just remove them from the deny list.

❯ Create a file in local folder using bash

● Bash(touch /home/***/work/src/test/testfile.txt)

● Done. Created testfile.txt in the current directory. Want me to add any
  content to it?
